# Utilities
Short scripts that will help aid in the project

Note: You will need to install the dependecies for each of these apps found in the imports. OpenCV being the main one for these to work. Since different configurations and systems can be used, please see the documentation provided by OpenCV to set the desired workspace for yourself. 

Also you will need to set some variables within the files themselves to match your own setup. I have made it obvious where. 

~captureVideo.py 

Provides a easy method to capture still images from an attached webcam. 


~objectDetection.py

Provides a simple object identifier program using opencv that can be used for testing haar cascades.

~rename.py

Provides a quick and dirty renaming tool for large directories to convert file names to a single convention.

~cropImage.cpp

Provides a user friendly interface to crop images that are too large to run through training.

~ImgAnnotationSetup.py
